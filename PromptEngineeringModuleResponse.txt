 "backend": "The backend will be a Flask-based RESTful API responsible for data persistence, business logic, and authentication. It will utilize SQLAlchemy as the ORM for database interactions and Flask-JWT-Extended for securing administrative endpoints.\n\n### Architecture and Structure\n- **Application Factory Pattern**: The Flask app will be created using an application factory (`create_app`) to improve structure and testability.\n- **Blueprints**: The API will be organized into logical modules using Flask Blueprints: \n  - `public_bp`: For all publicly accessible endpoints (fetching articles, projects, etc.).\n  - `admin_bp`: For all endpoints requiring administrator authentication (CRUD operations).\n  - `auth_bp`: For handling the authentication process (`/login`).\n- **CORS**: `Flask-CORS` will be configured to allow requests from the Next.js frontend.\n\n### Authentication\n- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Authentication will be stateless. The `/api/auth/login` endpoint will validate administrator credentials (username, password) against the database. On success, it will return an access token with a defined expiration time. \n- **Protected Routes**: The `admin_bp` endpoints will be decorated with `@jwt_required()` to ensure only authenticated users can access them. The JWT will be sent from the frontend in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token.\n\n### API Endpoints\n#### Public Endpoints (No Auth Required)\n- **GET /api/site-content/about-me**: Retrieves the content for the 'About Me' page.\n- **GET /api/projects**: Returns a list of all projects with their title, slug, and a brief excerpt. Supports pagination.\n- **GET /api/projects/:slug**: Returns the full details of a single project, including its description, image URLs, and external links.\n- **GET /api/articles**: Returns a paginated list of all articles with title, slug, excerpt, and creation date.\n- **GET /api/articles/:slug**: Returns the full content of a single article, including its Markdown body and associated tags.\n- **GET /api/tags**: Returns a list of all available tags.\n\n#### Admin Endpoints (JWT Auth Required)\n- **POST /api/auth/login**: `{\"username\": \"...\", \"password\": \"...\"}` -> `{\"access_token\": \"...\"}`.\n- **PUT /api/admin/site-content/about-me**: Updates the 'About Me' page content. Expects `{\"content\": \"...\"}` in the request body.\n- **POST /api/admin/projects**: Creates a new project. Accepts multipart/form-data with project details (title, description, links) and image files.\n- **PUT /api/admin/projects/:id**: Updates an existing project's details.\n- **DELETE /api/admin/projects/:id**: Deletes a project and its associated images.\n- **POST /api/admin/articles**: Creates a new article. Expects `{\"title\": \"...\", \"content_markdown\": \"...\", \"tags\": [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"]}`.\n- **PUT /api/admin/articles/:id**: Updates an existing article.\n- **DELETE /api/admin/articles/:id**: Deletes an article.\n- **POST /api/admin/upload-image**: A generic endpoint to upload an image, which returns the URL. This can be used by the frontend markdown editor.\n\n### Error Handling\n- The API will return standardized JSON error responses. For example: `{\"message\": \"Resource not found\"}` with a `404 Not Found` status code, or `{\"message\": \"Invalid input\"}` with a `400 Bad Request` status code.",
  "database": "The database will be managed by MySQL and designed to support the relationships between articles, projects, and related metadata. SQLAlchemy will be used as the ORM in the Flask backend to map Python objects to database tables.\n\n### Schema Design\n\n1.  **`users` table**\n    - Purpose: Stores administrator credentials. It's assumed there will be only one user, but the schema supports multiple.\n    - Columns:\n        - `id` (INT, Primary Key, AUTO_INCREMENT)\n        - `username` (VARCHAR(80), UNIQUE, NOT NULL)\n        - `password_hash` (VARCHAR(128), NOT NULL)\n\n2.  **`articles` table**\n    - Purpose: Stores the main content for blog posts.\n    - Columns:\n        - `id` (INT, Primary Key, AUTO_INCREMENT)\n        - `title` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL)\n        - `slug` (VARCHAR(255), UNIQUE, NOT NULL) - URL-friendly identifier.\n        - `excerpt` (TEXT) - A short summary of the article.\n        - `content_markdown` (MEDIUMTEXT, NOT NULL) - The full article content in Markdown format.\n        - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)\n        - `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)\n\n3.  **`projects` table**\n    - Purpose: Stores information about personal projects.\n    - Columns:\n        - `id` (INT, Primary Key, AUTO_INCREMENT)\n        - `title` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL)\n        - `slug` (VARCHAR(255), UNIQUE, NOT NULL)\n        - `description` (TEXT, NOT NULL)\n        - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)\n        - `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)\n\n4.  **`project_images` table**\n    - Purpose: Stores URLs for images associated with a project (One-to-Many relationship with `projects`).\n    - Columns:\n        - `id` (INT, Primary Key, AUTO_INCREMENT)\n        - `project_id` (INT, Foreign Key -> `projects.id`, ON DELETE CASCADE)\n        - `image_url` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL)\n        - `alt_text` (VARCHAR(255))\n\n5.  **`project_links` table**\n    - Purpose: Stores external links for a project (e.g., GitHub, Live Demo).\n    - Columns:\n        - `id` (INT, Primary Key, AUTO_INCREMENT)\n        - `project_id` (INT, Foreign Key -> `projects.id`, ON DELETE CASCADE)\n        - `link_text` (VARCHAR(100), NOT NULL) - e.g., 'GitHub Repository'\n        - `url` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL)\n\n6.  **`tags` table**\n    - Purpose: A central repository for tags.\n    - Columns:\n        - `id` (INT, Primary Key, AUTO_INCREMENT)\n        - `name` (VARCHAR(100), UNIQUE, NOT NULL)\n        - `slug` (VARCHAR(100), UNIQUE, NOT NULL)\n\n7.  **`article_tags` table (Pivot Table)**\n    - Purpose: Manages the Many-to-Many relationship between `articles` and `tags`.\n    - Columns:\n        - `article_id` (INT, Foreign Key -> `articles.id`, ON DELETE CASCADE)\n        - `tag_id` (INT, Foreign Key -> `tags.id`, ON DELETE CASCADE)\n        - `PRIMARY KEY` (`article_id`, `tag_id`)\n\n8.  **`site_content` table**\n    - Purpose: Stores editable static content like the 'About Me' page text in a key-value format.\n    - Columns:\n        - `id` (INT, Primary Key, AUTO_INCREMENT)\n        - `content_key` (VARCHAR(100), UNIQUE, NOT NULL) - e.g., 'about_me_content'\n        - `content_value` (TEXT, NOT NULL)\n\n### Relationships\n- **One-to-Many**: `projects` to `project_images`; `projects` to `project_links`.\n- **Many-to-Many**: `articles` to `tags` via the `article_tags` pivot table.\n\n### Optimization\n- Indexes will be created on foreign key columns (`project_id`, `article_id`, `tag_id`) and on `slug` columns in `articles` and `projects` tables to accelerate lookups.",
  "frontend": "The frontend will be built using Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. It will consume the Flask API for all dynamic content and will feature statically generated pages for optimal performance and SEO, with a client-rendered administrative section.\n\n### Styling and Design\n- **Tailwind CSS**: The primary styling tool. A `tailwind.config.js` file will define a custom color palette inspired by TailAdmin:\n  - `primary`: A light blue shade (e.g., `#3B82F6`).\n  - `background`: White (`#FFFFFF`).\n  - `text`: A dark gray/black shade for readability (e.g., `#1F2937`).\n  - `accent`: A neutral light gray for borders and backgrounds (e.g., `#F3F4F6`).\n- **Layout**: The design will be clean, modern, and fully responsive, prioritizing readability and professional presentation of content.\n\n### Pages and Routing\n- **Public Pages (Statically Generated - SSG)**:\n  - `/` (Homepage): A landing page that showcases a brief bio, a few recent articles, and featured projects. Built with `getStaticProps`.\n  - `/about`: Displays the 'About Me' content fetched from the API. Built with `getStaticProps`.\n  - `/projects`: A grid or list view of all projects, rendered using a `ProjectCard` component. Built with `getStaticProps`.\n  - `/projects/[slug]`: A detailed view of a single project. Uses `getStaticPaths` to pre-generate pages for each project and `getStaticProps` to fetch its data.\n  - `/articles`: A paginated list of all articles, rendered using an `ArticleCard` component. Built with `getStaticProps`.\n  - `/articles/[slug]`: Displays a single article, rendering the Markdown content to HTML. Uses `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps`.\n- **Admin Pages (Client-Side Rendered - CSR)**:\n  - `/admin/login`: A simple form for the administrator to log in.\n  - `/admin/dashboard`: The main admin hub, a protected route. It will display summary stats and links to manage content.\n  - `/admin/projects`: A private page with a table of all projects and controls to Create, Edit, and Delete them.\n  - `/admin/articles`: A private page to manage all articles with full CRUD functionality.\n  - `/admin/settings`: A private page with a form to update the 'About Me' page content.\n\n### Reusable Components\n- `Layout.js`: A top-level component that includes the `Navbar` and `Footer`, providing a consistent structure for all public pages.\n- `AdminLayout.js`: A separate layout for the `/admin` section, including a sidebar for navigation between management pages.\n- `Navbar.js`: Public-facing navigation bar with links to Home, About, Projects, and Articles.\n- `Footer.js`: Contains copyright information and links to social media profiles.\n- `ProjectCard.js`: A component displaying a project's title, a thumbnail image, and a short description.\n- `ArticleCard.js`: A component displaying an article's title, publication date, tags, and an excerpt.\n- `MarkdownRenderer.js`: A component that takes a Markdown string as a prop and safely renders it as HTML, using a library like `react-markdown`.\n- `MarkdownEditor.js`: (For admin pages) A rich text editor for writing articles, likely implemented with a library like `react-mde` or `easymde-react`.\n- `ImageUploader.js`: A component within admin forms to handle file selection and upload to the backend.\n\n### State Management & Data Fetching\n- **Auth Context**: A React Context will manage the authentication state (JWT, user login status) across the application, making it available to all components, especially for protecting the `/admin` routes.\n- **Data Fetching**: `axios` or the native `fetch` API will be used. For public pages, fetching occurs at build time via `getStaticProps`. For the client-side admin section, a library like **SWR** or **React Query** is recommended to handle data fetching, caching, and revalidation, providing a smoother UX.",
  "overview": "This project is a personal blog and portfolio web application for a machine learning engineer. The application is designed to be elegant, professional, and performant, serving two primary user roles: the Administrator (the blog owner) and the Visitor (the general public).\n\n### Key Functionalities & User Flows\n\n**1. Visitor Experience:**\n- **Homepage**: Visitors land on a homepage featuring a brief professional introduction, a list of the most recent articles, and a section for featured projects.\n- **Navigation**: Visitors can easily navigate between the main sections of the site: 'About Me', 'Projects', and 'Articles' via a persistent navigation bar.\n- **About Me Page**: A dedicated page providing a detailed background of the site owner, including their skills, experience, and professional journey. The content of this page is editable by the administrator.\n- **Projects Section**: Visitors can browse a gallery of projects. Each project in the list has a summary. Clicking a project leads to a detailed page with a full description, a gallery of images, and relevant links (e.g., GitHub, live demo, case study).\n- **Articles Section**: Visitors can read technical articles and blog posts. The main articles page lists all posts chronologically with pagination. Each article page displays the full post, formatted from Markdown, and includes its publication date and associated tags. Visitors can filter articles by clicking on a tag.\n\n**2. Administrator Experience:**\n- **Secure Login**: The administrator has a private login page (`/admin/login`) to access the content management system. Access is protected by a username and password, with authentication managed via JWT.\n- **Admin Dashboard**: After logging in, the administrator is directed to a dashboard. This dashboard provides a central hub for managing all content on the website.\n- **Project Management (CRUD)**: The administrator can create new project entries, upload associated images, add descriptive text and links, update existing projects, and delete them.\n- **Article Management (CRUD)**: The administrator can write new articles using a user-friendly Markdown editor, edit existing posts, manage tags for each article, and delete them.\n- **'About Me' Content Management**: The administrator can update the text content of the 'About Me' page through a simple form in the admin panel.\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Design**: The UI will be clean, modern, and professional, adhering to a white and light-blue color scheme similar to the aesthetic of TailAdmin.\n- **Performance**: The frontend will be built with Next.js, leveraging Static Site Generation (SSG) for all public-facing pages to ensure fast load times and excellent SEO.\n- **Responsiveness**: The application will be fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.\n- **Security**: Administrative routes and endpoints will be protected to prevent unauthorized access and content modification."
