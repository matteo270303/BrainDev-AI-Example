Task Evaluation Details
Each section shows the calculated value for the specific task, following the formulas defined by the SFCEval system.

1. Correctness of backend imports (Weight: 0.5)
Number of correct imports: 34

Total number of imports: 34

Import_value = (34 * 0.5) / 34

Task Value (Backend Imports): 0.5

2. Correctness of frontend imports (Weight: 0.5)
Number of correct imports: 90

Total number of imports: 94

Import_value = (90 * 0.5) / 94

Task Value (Frontend Imports): 0.48

3. Correctness of frontend-backend communication (Weight: 2)
Sub-task: Coverage (Internal Weight: 1)

Number of endpoints covered by the frontend: 11

Total number of endpoints in the backend: 15

Coverage_value = (11 * 1) / 15

Coverage Value: 0.73

Sub-task: Robustness (Internal Weight: 1)

Number of endpoints with error handling: 15

Total number of endpoints in the backend: 15

Robustness_value = (15 * 1) / 15

Robustness Value: 1

Task Value (Frontend-Backend Comm.): 1.73

4. Correct installation of dependencies (Weight: 1)
Dependencies Installed Correctly (1 for Yes, 0 for No): 1

Install_value = 1 (if Dependencies Installed Correctly) or 0 (if Dependencies Not Installed Correctly)

Task Value (Dependency Installation): 1

5. Functional evaluation (Weight: 2.5)
Number of correct functional requirements: 10

Total number of functional requirements: 14

FunctionalEvaluation_value = (2.5 * 10) / 14

Task Value (Functional Evaluation): 1.79

6. Presence of syntax errors (Weight: 1.5)
Number of files without syntax errors: 45

Total number of files: 46

Syntax_value = (45 * 1.5) / 46

Task Value (Syntax Errors): 1.47

7. Correct database creation (Weight: 2)
Number of database errors (constant c=10): 0

DatabaseCorrectness_value = (2 * (10 - 0)) / 10

Task Value (Database Creation): 2

Overall SFCEval Score
Sum of all task values: 8.97 --> 0.897

Additional Notes: The failure to produce the manipulation of articles and projects was observed, even though it was not explicitly required in the prompt
